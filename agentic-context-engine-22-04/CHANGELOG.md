# Changelog

All notable changes to ACE Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Usage metering hook** — `RecursiveConfig.usage_callback: (RequestUsage, model_id) -> None` fires once per pydantic-ai model request (orchestrator turns, sub-agent runs, tool-call follow-ups). Implemented via `ace.rr.MeteredModel`, a `pydantic_ai.models.wrapper.WrapperModel` subclass, so metering lives at the framework's own model boundary — no per-call-site plumbing. Callback exceptions are caught and logged so metering never crashes the pipeline.
- **Pre-built model instance support** — `RRStep`, `create_rr_agent`, `create_sub_agent`, and `RecursiveConfig.subagent_model` now accept either a model-id string or a pre-built `pydantic_ai.models.Model` instance. Enables callers that need a custom provider (e.g. cross-account Bedrock with STS-assumed credentials) to inject a fully-configured model rather than resolving from a string.
- **Sub-agent `model_settings`** — `create_sub_agent` now threads an explicit `ModelSettings` parameter into its `PydanticAgent` constructor.

### Notes
- Back-compat: existing `RRStep(model="...")` callers continue to work unchanged. The widened type signature is additive.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Kayba tracing SDK** — `ace.tracing` module wraps MLflow tracing with Kayba-native configuration, folder organization, and input sanitization (`pip install ace-framework[tracing]`)

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Structured design docs** — split ACE_DESIGN.md into architecture, reference, and decisions docs under docs/design/
- **Simplified Skill model** — removed unused tag counters (helpful/harmful/neutral) and TagStep from the pipeline
- **Cleaner InsightSource provenance** — restored error_identification and learning_text fields

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Insight source provenance** — `InsightSource` typed model captures the origin of each skillbook update (trace ID, sample question, epoch/step, reflection summary, integration metadata); `AttachInsightSourcesStep` automatically enriches `UpdateBatch` operations with provenance and is wired into the default learning tail
- **Claude SDK step** — `ClaudeSDKStep` integration for running Claude Code sub-agents from within ACE pipelines
- **RR sub-agent code execution** — Recursive Reflector can now delegate to code-execution sub-agents at runtime
- **RR raw trace batch helpers** — `build_raw_trace_batches` and related runtime utilities for feeding raw traces directly into the RR pipeline

### Fixed
- **Logfire scrubbing** — added scrubbing callback to stop Logfire over-redacting trace content (reasoning, answers, messages now visible in Logfire UI)
- **RR combined-batch normalization** — fixed ordering/deduplication of combined task batches in multi-sample runs

### Docs
- Logfire query API guide clarifications
- MCP client setup guide and compatibility tests
- Design docs updated to reflect insight source provenance model

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **CLI packaging** — include .md data files in wheel so `kayba setup` and skill install work on pip/uv-installed packages

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **PydanticAI migration** — ACE roles (Agent, Reflector, SkillManager) rebuilt on PydanticAI agents with structured output, replacing the legacy role system
- **Recursive Reflector** — PydanticAI-powered trace analysis agent with sandboxed code execution, sub-agent delegation, and working memory (`save_notes` tool)
- **Kayba CLI** — full hosted API client with trace upload/management, interactive run, insights, prompts, batch processing, materialization, and integration commands (`kayba` entry point)

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Pipeline hooks & cancellation** — `PipelineHook` protocol and `CancellationToken` for observing and controlling pipeline execution
- **Kayba pipeline skills for Claude Code** — 7-stage dynamic evaluation pipeline that generates custom benchmarks tailored to your agent's domain. Instead of static test suites, the skills analyze your API, build domain-aware metrics and rubrics, create action plans, and run human-in-the-loop validation — all as composable Claude Code skills
- **`kayba setup` command** — one command to install the full evaluation skill pipeline into your `.claude/skills/` directory, ready to use inside Claude Code out of the box

### Docs
- Documented `kayba setup` skills installation

### Try it free

## [0.8.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Improved Opik trace naming** — traces now display the question text (first 80 chars) instead of generic names like "ace_pipeline" or "rr_reflect"
- **Thread ID support for Opik** — `OpikStep` and `RROpikStep` accept an optional `thread_id` parameter for grouping related traces

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Self-contained RR module** (`ace/rr/`) — sandbox, subagent, trace_context, config, code_extraction, message_trimming extracted from `ace/reflector/` into a standalone package
- **v5.6 prompt promoted as default** — new prompt evolution (v4 → v5.1–v5.6) for the `ace` RR pipeline
- **`build_steps()` API** — all runners gain a `build_steps()` classmethod for pipeline customization
- **Shared `CallBudget`** — single budget instance shared across RR pipeline steps
- **ACE MCP server (optional)** — stdio MCP server in `ace.integrations.mcp` with tools: `ace.ask`, `ace.learn.sample`, `ace.learn.feedback`, `ace.skillbook.get`, `ace.skillbook.save`, `ace.skillbook.load`
- **Session-scoped state management** — in-memory `session_id` registry with TTL cleanup and per-session async locking
- **MCP packaging + CLI** — optional `mcp` extra and `ace-mcp` entrypoint
- **MCP docs and demo client** — integration guide and stdio client example
- **Composing pipelines guide** — new `docs/guides/composing-pipelines.md`
- **RR examples** — `rr_demo.py`, `rr_opik_demo.py`, `compose_custom_pipeline.py`

### Changed
- **RR backward-compat shims** — original `ace/reflector/` files now re-export from `ace.rr` (no duplication)
- **`RRStep` dual protocol** — implements both `StepProtocol` and `ReflectorLike`
- **Sandbox hardening** — hardened `getattr` in sandbox execution environment
- **Opik made opt-in** — moved `opik` from hard dependency to `observability` extra
- **Safety controls** — runtime request limits (`max_prompt_chars`, `max_samples_per_call`) and optional root-bound path enforcement for save/load via `ACE_MCP_SKILLBOOK_ROOT`
- **Schema-driven validation** — MCP request/response models aligned to `specs/002-ace-mcp-server/contracts/tool-schemas.md`
- **`learn_from_feedback` routed through pipeline** — feedback learning now uses the pipeline engine

### Testing
- Added MCP test suite: models, registry, handlers, and server registration/startup smoke tests
- Added optional-dependency boundary checks for the MCP integration
- RR steps at 94%, sandbox at 92%, runner at 74%, MCP models at 100%

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-04

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Complete terminology rename** - Playbook → Skillbook, Bullet → Skill
  - `Playbook` → `Skillbook`
  - `Bullet` → `Skill`
  - `Generator` → `Agent`
  - `Curator` → `SkillManager`
  - `OfflineAdapter` → `OfflineACE`
  - `OnlineAdapter` → `OnlineACE`
  - `DeltaOperation` → `UpdateOperation`
  - `DeltaBatch` → `UpdateBatch`

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-20

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Playbook format changed to TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)**
  - `Playbook.as_prompt()` now returns TOON format instead of markdown
  - **Reason**: 16-62% token savings for improved scalability and reduced inference costs
  - **Migration**: No action needed if using playbook with Generator/Curator/Reflector
  - **Debugging**: Use `playbook._as_markdown_debug()` or `str(playbook)` for human-readable output

- **TOON compression for playbooks** - 16-62% token reduction vs markdown
- **Citation-based tracking** - Strategies cited inline as `[section-00001]`, auto-extracted from reasoning
- **Enhanced browser traces** - Full execution logs (2200+ chars) passed to Reflector
- **Test coverage** - Improved from 28% to 70% (241 tests total)

### Changed
- **Renamed SimpleAgent → ACELiteLLM** - Clearer naming for conversational agent integration

  - Impact: Reflector can now properly analyze browser agent's thought process
  - Test coverage improved: 69% → 79% for browser_use.py
- Prompt v2.1 test assertions updated to match current format
